# JUMPlus-Project-2
Originally a reimplementation of [JUMPlus-Project-1](https://github.com/ajnorthouse/JUMPlus-Project-1) done purely in JavaScript, it then transitioned into becoming a web-app using React and node.js. To repeat what was said on the first project:
> "The project goal was to create a mock console application that a user could use to access a database (either external or in memory) to interact with their banking account. The main goals with this was to implement a MVC architecture, testing, and have the console print statements in color."

The project uses memory to store objects, and largely followed the react architecture instead of the MVC architecture.
